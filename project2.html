            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict credit risk, aiming to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. By developing a scorecard based on various criteria, we empower organizations to assess loan applications effectively and minimize default rates.

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <div class="project-details">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Credit risk assessment is critical for financial institutions to mitigate potential losses from loan defaults. Understanding the factors influencing creditworthiness can help lenders implement better risk management strategies and ensure responsible lending practices.

        <!-- Approach and Methodology -->
        <div class="project-details">
            <h2>Approach and Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                We gathered a comprehensive dataset of loan applications and employed extensive preprocessing steps, including handling missing data, normalization, and feature selection. Multiple models were evaluated, with a gradient boosting model chosen for its strong performance in classifying credit risk.

            <p>
                The final model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an AUC of 90%, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying high-risk applicants. Feature importance analysis indicated that income, credit history, and outstanding debts were key predictors of creditworthiness. The web application facilitates real-time predictions, allowing lenders to make data-driven decisions swiftly.
