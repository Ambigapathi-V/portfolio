            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict insurance premiums based on various features like age, gender, and coverage plans. The goal is to provide a tool that can assist insurance companies in determining accurate premium prices and help customers understand how different factors influence their insurance costs.

        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <div class="project-details">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                Insurance companies often struggle with accurately pricing premiums due to the variability in customer profiles. This project aimed to address this issue by using machine learning to predict premium prices based on customer data.

        <!-- Approach and Methodology -->
        <div class="project-details">
            <h2>Approach and Methodology</h2>
            <p>
                The data was sourced from Kaggle's insurance dataset. Key preprocessing steps included handling missing values, normalizing data, and one-hot encoding categorical variables. Several models were tested, including linear regression and random forest, with the final model selected based on accuracy and interpretability.
